<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
The GNU <CODE>gperf</CODE> perfect hash function generator utility was
written in GNU C++ by Douglas C. Schmidt.  The general
idea for the perfect hash function generator was inspired by Keith
Bostic's algorithm written in C, and distributed to net.sources around
1984.  The current program is a heavily modified, enhanced, and extended
implementation of Keith's basic idea, created at the University of
California, Irvine.  The program was forked and modified by Sei Lisa.
Bugs, patches, and suggestions should be reported to
<CODE>&#60;seilisasl@gmail.com&#62;</CODE>.

<LI>

Special thanks is extended to Michael Tiemann and Doug Lea, for
providing a useful compiler, and for giving me a forum to exhibit my
creation.

In addition, Adam de Boor and Nels Olson provided many tips and insights
that greatly helped improve the quality and functionality of <CODE>gperf</CODE>.

<LI>

Bruno Haible enhanced and optimized the search algorithm.  He also rewrote
the input routines and the output routines for better reliability, and
added a testsuite.

<LI>

Sei Lisa forked GNU gperf as gperf-HFN to add output of the hash function
in a machine-readable form, to enable creation of hash function compilers
for other languages.
